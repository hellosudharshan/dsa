That is perfect! Having Python installed means the "plumbing" is already there.

Since the last part felt like a lot, let’s make this 100% practical and very small. We are going to build the "Ear" first. No complex AI logic yet—just a script that listens to you for 5 seconds and tells you what you said.

Step 1: The "Ear" Setup
We need one specific library called SpeechRecognition. It’s much friendlier for beginners than the professional "streaming" tools we tried earlier.

Open your Terminal (CMD) and run this:

Bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3
(Note: pyttsx3 is the "Mouth"—it lets Python talk back to you!)

Step 2: The "Listen & Speak" Script
Copy this into a new file called test_lumi.py. This is the simplest version of Lumi possible. It will listen, turn your voice into text, and then speak that text back to you.

Python
import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3

# 1. Setup the 'Mouth' (Text-to-Speech)
engine = pyttsx3.init()
engine.say("Lumi is awake. Talk to me!")
engine.runAndWait()

# 2. Setup the 'Ear' (Microphone)
r = sr.Recognizer()

with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Listening...")
    audio = r.listen(source)

try:
    # Use Google's free service to turn audio into text
    text = r.recognize_google(audio)
    print(f"You said: {text}")
    
    # Lumi repeats it back
    engine.say(f"I heard you say: {text}")
    engine.runAndWait()

except:
    print("Sorry, I didn't catch that.")
Why this is a win:
No APIs: It uses a built-in Google engine that doesn't require keys or secrets.

Instant Feedback: You’ll hear Lumi’s voice immediately.

Simple Logic: It’s just "Listen -> Transcribe -> Speak."

Your Task:
Run python test_lumi.py.

Say "Hello Lumi, can you hear me?"

If Lumi speaks back to you, you have officially built the Ear and the Mouth.
