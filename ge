### 📝 Project Context: "Lumi" – Empathic AI Companion

**Current Goal:** Build a fully local (no API) emotionally intelligent chatbot that detects user feelings via voice and responds empathetically with a reactive visual interface.

**Technical Stack (Local/No API):**

* **Speech-to-Text (The Ear):** OpenAI `Whisper` (base model) via Python.
* **Emotion Analysis (The Heart):** Hugging Face `distilroberta-base-emotion` (Local transformer model).
* **Conversational Brain:** `Ollama` running `Llama 3`.
* **Environment:** Windows 11 with `sounddevice` for microphone handling.

**Progress So Far:**

1. Attempted cloud integration with Hume AI, but decided to move **100% Local** for privacy and learning depth.
2. Verified microphone devices (Device 1: Microphone Array).
3. Architected the "Sense-Feel-Think" loop where Whisper transcribes voice $\rightarrow$ RoBERTa classifies emotion $\rightarrow$ Ollama generates a response based on that emotion.

**Next Immediate Task:**
Implementing the **Phase 2: The Face** (Visual GUI). We need to create a simple Python-based window (using `Tkinter` or `PyQt`) that displays a "Cute Face" which changes its expression (Joy, Sadness, Neutral) based on the output of the local emotion classifier.

### 🚀 What to do next on your new computer:

1. **Install Ollama** and run `ollama run llama3`.
2. **Install the Python environment:** `pip install transformers torch whisper-openai sounddevice numpy requests`
3. **Run a test script** to ensure your microphone is picking up audio through `sounddevice`.

**Would you like me to generate the first "Face" script for you now, so you have the visual code ready for the new computer?**
