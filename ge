Step 3: The "Heart" (Feeling the Vibe)
Instead of a big, scary AI model, we are going to use a very clever Python library called textblob. It’s simple: it gives any sentence a score from -1 (very sad/angry) to +1 (very happy).

1. Install the "Heart"
Open your terminal and run:

Bash
pip install textblob
2. Update the Code
We are going to add a few lines to your script. Now, Lumi will listen to you, check your mood, and change her response based on your "vibe."

Replace your code in test_lumi.py with this:

Python
import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3
from textblob import TextBlob

engine = pyttsx3.init()
r = sr.Recognizer()

with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Lumi is feeling your vibe... Speak now!")
    audio = r.listen(source)

try:
    text = r.recognize_google(audio)
    print(f"You said: {text}")

    # --- THE HEART LOGIC ---
    analysis = TextBlob(text)
    sentiment = analysis.sentiment.polarity # This is a number between -1 and 1

    if sentiment > 0.1:
        mood = "You sound happy! That makes me smile."
    elif sentiment < -0.1:
        mood = "You sound a bit down. I'm here for you."
    else:
        mood = "I hear you loud and clear."

    print(f"Lumi senses: {mood}")
    engine.say(mood)
    engine.runAndWait()

except:
    print("I'm listening, but I didn't hear anything.")
How to test the "Heart":
The Happy Test: Say "I am having an amazing day, everything is perfect!"

Lumi should notice the positive vibe.

The Sad Test: Say "I am feeling really tired and frustrated today."

Lumi should notice the negative vibe.

Why this is cool:
You didn't need a massive supercomputer for this. You just taught Python to recognize the "emotional weight" of words.
